# CQBot

A Twitch bot for automatically pulling up teams for Champions Queue games.

Based off of https://github.com/TwitchIO/TwitchIO

Using tweets from https://twitter.com/ChampionsQueue

# How to use

Go to https://www.twitch.tv/deadfracture and do "!team (Twitch name of streamer in game)"

If you would like to add this bot to your channel, you can do "!join" in my channel! If you would like the bot to leave, do "!leave"

Also added a !challenger (region) command to show the Summoner Name & LP of the lowest Challenger player in the region, for the purpose of allowing streamers trying to hit Challenger to know and share an up-to-date LP goal. Currently not working due to no public API key (yet)
